    "# Strands Agents Introduction Notebook\n",
    "In this notebook we explore the open source [Strands-Agents framework](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) provided by Amazon. With Strands you can easily integrate with Amazon Bedrock and also other model providers in an agnostic format. Via Strands there's built-in tools, easy integration with Bedrock's large model family, and also a developer friendly multi-agentic setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to use Bedrock specifically you can also work with the managed Bedrock Agents service which is more tightly coupled with other AWS services such as Lambda, OpenSearch, and more. We'll also explore this option in a future series. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the mean-time in this notebook we'll explore how to setup a Strands Agent integrate it with both a built-in and custom tool that you can define to get started with the framework."
