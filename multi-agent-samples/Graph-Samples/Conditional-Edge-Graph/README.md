# Conditional Edge Graph

Stock trading decision system using conditional graph routing in Strands.

## How it Works

1. **Retriever** gets mock stock price
2. **Conditional routing** based on price:
   - Price < $500 â†’ Buy agent  
   - Price > $500 â†’ Sell agent
3. **Agent** makes buy/sell recommendation

## Quick Start

```bash
python main.py
```

## Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py      # Main execution
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py    # Model & prompts  
â”œâ”€â”€ tools.py     # Stock price tool
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py     # Routing logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md    # This file
